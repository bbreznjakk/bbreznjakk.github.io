## 🚀 Getting Started

Welcome to the docker-kubernetes-desktop-demo-wpysql! This is a simple way to run a Flask application that works with a PostgreSQL database. It uses Docker and Kubernetes to manage everything for you, allowing you to focus on using the application rather than setting it up.

## 📦 Requirements

Before you dive in, make sure your computer can support this application. Here are the system requirements:

- **Operating System:** Windows, macOS, or Linux
- **Memory:** At least 4 GB of RAM
- **Disk Space:** At least 1 GB for the application and its data
- **Docker:** Install the latest version of Docker Desktop
- **Kubernetes:** This is included in Docker Desktop, but you may need to enable it in settings.

## 🛠️ Installation Steps

To get started with the docker-kubernetes-desktop-demo-wpysql, follow these steps:

1. **Download the Application**  
   Click the link below to visit the Releases page:

2. **Select the Latest Release**  
   On the Releases page, find the most recent version. It will be at the top. Click that version.

3. **Download the Files**  
   You may find several files for different systems. If you see a zip file, click to download it. Save it to a folder you can remember, like your Desktop.

4. **Extract the Files**  
   After downloading, locate the zip file. Right-click on it and select "Extract All" or a similar option, depending on your OS. This will create a new folder with all necessary files.

5. **Open Your Terminal**  
   If you are on Windows, search for Command Prompt (cmd). If you are on macOS or Linux, open your Terminal app.

6. **Navigate to the Folder**  
   In the terminal, type `cd` followed by the path to the folder where you extracted the files. For example, if you saved it on your Desktop, type:  
   `cd ~/Desktop/docker-kubernetes-desktop-demo-wpysql`  
   Press Enter.

7. **Start Docker**  
   Make sure Docker Desktop is running. Check the Docker icon in your system tray or menu bar. If it’s not running, start it up.

8. **Run the Application**  
   Now, type the following command in your terminal:  
   `docker-compose up`  
   Press Enter. This command will start the application along with the PostgreSQL database.

9. **Access the Application**  
   Once the application loads, you can access it from your web browser. Open a web browser and go to:  
   `http://localhost:5000`  
   You should see the Flask application loaded and ready to use.
